# KFC Double Down

As you may have seen ads for the last couple of weeks, KFC brought back the [Double Down](https://www.kfc.com/menu/sandwiches/double-down). Basically, a chicken sandwich but replacing the lame bread carbs with friend chicken carbs.

* Fried Chicken
* Cheese
* Mayo
* Bacon
* Fried Chicken

Hard to mess that up, even for KFC. 

## Review

I had my doubts when I heard KFC was paid off by Blizzard to include Diablo 4 beta keys with each sandwich. I had more doubts when I saw it. My thoughts changed with the first bite.
The Double Down was great, although being the first meal after a seven day fast may have contributed to its greatness.

It was not surprising that I loved the Double Down so much, I am not a big bread guy. Trading chicken for bread is my dream for every meal from now on.

You probably should eat it with a fork (I didn't) because the insides fell everywhere when I buried my face in it.
Overall, the sandwich (is it still a sandwich without bread?) was very good.

Go buy one today. Try the spicy one.

#### Pros:
* Chicken
* Chicken
* Chicken

#### Cons:
* $9 in my area is bit outrageous when compared to Taco Bell's Craving Value Menu.
* Might stain your shirt.
