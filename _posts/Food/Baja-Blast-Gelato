# Taco Bell Baja Blast Gelato

Taco Bell has released their Baja Blast Gelato [Gelato](https://www.tacobell.com/newsroom/taco-bell-and-mtn-dew-commemorate-20th-bajaversary).


## Review

As a someone who eats way too much Tbell, I had to give the new release a try day one. As a gelato, it is bad. As a food item with Baja Blast, it is good. The texture is different than any other gelato I have had.

Baja Blast is a good flavor, so the bar is low on making new items be acceptable with it. The price, however, is not acceptable. $3.99 can get you 2.5 value menu items and the portion is tiny (although that is probably okay for some of us 

#### Pros:
* Tasty
* Refreshing
* Spoon Included, so efficient

#### Cons:
* $3.99 is absurd for the portion size.
* Texture a little off for being Gelato
