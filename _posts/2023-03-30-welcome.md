# Welcome

I apologize, you have made it to the Girthy Tannins Blog. 

I am tired of watching/reading these long, drawn-out reviews with click-bait titles. My goal is to provide quick reviews that the average "joe" can relate with only a weekly basis.

Please Keep in mind that I really have no idea what I am doing.

## WTF is with the Name??

From hanging around people who consume copious amount of wine, I have continually heard the word "tannins" when they attempt to one up each otherâ€™s description of the wine they just sniffed/drank/whatever you do with wine. What the hell is a tannin you may ask? See for [yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin).

When describing tannins, I have heard wine people refer to them as "earthy". Once again, I have no idea what that means and don't care to know.
Somehow, I jumped from earthy tannins to girthy tannins, verified that girthytannins.com was available, and here we are.

Once again, I apologize that you made it here.

## Plan for the Future
