## Why I went Electric

Most of the cars I have owned have been turbocharged, manual 4 bangers - more recently, Honda Civic Si (coupe - RIP).

I had reserved a Rivian R1T in 2021, so the IONIQ 5 interested me as a way to try EV life before dropping $80k on a truck from an unknown company.
Why not Tesla? At the time, The IONIQ 5 was eligible for the full $7500 tax incentive while Tesla models were not.

## Highlights

The IONIQ5 is an **almost** perfect daily driver for me, and it would be for most people out there.

The acceleration is very good (~ 5 sec 0-60), but not unwieldy for most drivers, and it rides luxuriously compared to other EVs I have driven. One thing to note is the wheelbase is comparable to larger SUVs, which affects the driving feel a bit.

Eco mode is cool because it makes it FWD to get more range. I didn't use that much though in my short time with the car.

It has plenty of storage due to the flat floor and large trunk, it is deceptively large inside, but also drive like it.

The UI for the center screen was mostly okay, but it supports Android Auto/Apple CarPlay so who cares - only wired though...even in the 2023 models.

Charging: DC Fast charging in this vehicle was reliable and quick (up to 350kWh) from my experience. Two years of DC charging through Electrify America was included with the purchase. Finding functionally EA chargers will be another post.

## Downsides

Most of these downsides come from the perspective of driving/owning other EVs since the IONIQ 5. These might not apply as first EV owners. 
* 1-Pedal drive not always - required to use the paddle shifters to change regen braking levels and will not stay on the max level of 1-pedal when the car is turned off or changes gears.
* Did not have preconditioning for DC fast charging - I believe it a manual precondition was added via software
* No OTA - I believe the 2023s do

## Verdict

**7.5/10**

Great daily driver, quick and handles well enough with plenty of room for whatever.
The lack of 1-pedal locking on would be enough for me to look elsewhere.

If you do get this car, go with the Limited trim if possible. Or the Disney one (link) https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/2024-ioniq-5-d100-platinum

I am looking forward to the IONIQ 6.
